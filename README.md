# RayTracing
Here I am implementing a simple ray-tracing code based on the article "Ray Tracing in One Weekend"<br/>
<br/>
## Goals
* understand what ray tracing is and how to implement it.<br/>
* explore new tools like dispaying images and learn advanced math.<br/>
* have fun and get some cool pictures to show mom and dad :)
